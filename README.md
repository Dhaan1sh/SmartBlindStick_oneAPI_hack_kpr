# Object Detection, Obstacle Warning, and GPS Tracking System

## Project Overview
This project is an object detection, obstacle warning, and GPS tracking system built using a Raspberry Pi 4, YOLOv5 for object detection, an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, and a GPS module for tracking location. The system detects objects in real-time using a camera and provides verbal warnings through a text-to-speech (TTS) engine if an obstacle is detected directly in front of the user. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to obstacles, and if an object is closer than 50 cm, a warning is issued.

Additionally, the system uses a GPS module to continuously track and log the user's location. This GPS data can be integrated with mapping services for real-time tracking or location-based functionalities.

This project aims to help users navigate safely in various environments by detecting obstacles in their path and providing information on their location.

## Camera Configuration
The Raspberry Pi Camera is used with the Picamera2 library for video capture and processing. It connects to the camera port on the Raspberry Pi and streams video at a resolution of 640x480 pixels.

## Features
- **Object Detection:** Real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Measures the distance to objects using an ultrasonic sensor and provides warnings if objects are detected within 50 cm.
- **GPS Tracking:** Continuously tracks the userâ€™s location using a GPS module and logs the coordinates for real-time tracking or location analysis.
- **Verbal Warnings:** Uses a TTS engine to provide voice alerts for obstacles and other relevant information.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Displays object detection results with bounding boxes on a live video stream.
